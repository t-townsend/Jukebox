### A JQuery Song Player ###

This is a music player where you can add a name and notes to the form, and on
submit, it adds the song to the main list area. After Play all is pressed, the
songs are played in order, starting with the first one on the list. After they
have played, the song is deleted from the list. The Play All button animates and
disappears when pressed, and reappears when the songs have concluded. This was
an assignment, where the code to implement the player was provided, but I coded
all the jQuery and Javascript for the list and the player to work when the page
was loaded.

**Technologies Used: JQuery, Javascript, CSS, HTML, DOM Manipulation**
